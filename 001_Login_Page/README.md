 # Challenge 001 – Login Page 🔐

## 🎯 Goal
Design and code a modern, user-friendly login page interface.

## 🛠️ What I Did
This challenge was completed using:
- **HTML** (`dailyui001.html`)
- **CSS** (`assets/style.css`)
- **Icons** sourced directly from [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/) via CDN

The layout is responsive and focuses on clarity, accessibility, and visual balance.

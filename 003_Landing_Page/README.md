# Challenge 003 – Landing Page 🧑‍🍳

## 🎯 Goal  
Design and build a visually creative landing page centered around a brand ("Pasta") using modern UI elements, animations, and responsive layout.

## 🛠️ What I Did  
This challenge was implemented using:
- **HTML** (`DailyUI003.html`)
- **CSS** (`assets/css/style.css`)
- **JavaScript** with **ScrollReveal.js** for scroll animations
- Custom layout with a central “S” letter reveal and split text heading

Key highlights:
- Scroll-based animation on page elements using `ScrollReveal()`
- Background effects using `body::before` and `body::after`
- Responsive layout and icon-based navigation using Boxicons
- Beautiful typography using **Poppins** and **Sarina** from Google Fonts

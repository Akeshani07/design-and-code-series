# Challenge 002 – Credit Card Checkout 💳

## 🎯 Goal
Design and build a visually engaging and interactive credit card checkout form that mimics a real-world payment experience.

## 🛠️ What I Did
This challenge was implemented using:
- **HTML** (`DailyUI002.html`)
- **CSS** (`assets/css/style.css`)
- **Inline JavaScript** for real-time interaction and validation
- Custom 3D card flip animation using CSS and JS

The layout is responsive and simulates a dynamic credit card interface with front and back views that flip when focusing on the CVV field.

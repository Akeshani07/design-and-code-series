# ðŸ’» Design and Code Series

This repository contains my ongoing progress through the [Daily UI Challenge](https://www.dailyui.co/). Each challenge focuses on designing and coding user interface components or screens using front-end technologies. The goal is to improve my UI/UX skills, design thinking, and front-end development proficiency.
